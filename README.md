# My Arduino repository
Author: Michael Kimmer

## Overview
This repository is my messy Arduino projects backup. 

## Used Hardware
- Arduino Nano
- Arduino Nano 33 BLE
- ESP-01 (ESP8266 WIFI module)

## Highlights
- nano/LED_CUBE --- Working project for LED Cube.
- ESP8266/wifiClient_tcpServer --- Primitive connection of LED Cube to Wifi (Receives Telnet and sends it to the LED Cube by UART)
- nano/magnet_levitation --- Attempt of PID regulator for magnet levitation with 4 coils and 2 Hall sensors.
- nano_33_ble_sense/IMU_all --- Attempt of Dead reckoning by IMU (Accelerometers very inaccurate)
